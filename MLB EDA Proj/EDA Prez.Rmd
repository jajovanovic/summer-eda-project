> ** - Understanding baseball data **

--

> ** - Exploring MLB data to identify and communicate trends**

--

> ** - Inform future models that could predict outcomes and improve performance **

# Background
### Dataset:

- Batted balls data from the 2022 MLB season through June 10th

- 7,085 observations, 31 variables

- e.g., information on batter’s stand, before and after counts, speed, batted ball type, hit distance, pitch type, outcome, and score

```{r, table, echo = FALSE}
Batting %>% 
  select(player_name, stand, events, release_speed, bb_type, 
         hit_distance_sc) %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = 'html')
```

# Background
### Methods:
.pull-left[
a. **Events re-coded as "On-Base", "Out", or "Homerun"**
```{r eval=FALSE}
mutate(events = 
    fct_recode(events, 
    "On-base" = "double", 
    "On-base" = "field_error",
    "Out" = "double_play",
    "Out" = "field_out",
    "On-base" = "fielders_choice",
    "Out" = "fielders_choice_out",
    "Homerun" = "home_run"
    ...
```

       
]

.pull-right[

b. **Pitch Types re-coded as "Fastball", "Change-up", and "Breaking Ball"**

```{r eval=FALSE}
mutate(pitch_type =
    fct_recode(pitch_type, 
               "Changeup" = "CH", 
               "Breaking ball" = "CU",

# Discussion

- Most common way of getting out: field out 

- Batted balls from left-handed vs right-handed batters do differ (marginally significant)
  
- The probability of a pitch being thrown is not constant throughout an at bat
      - The only type of pitch thrown during a 3-0 count is a fastball
--

### Limitations

- Relatively small dataset, only 3 months into the season

- Team names are not included in the dataset

- Next steps: analyzing scores/results depending on batted balls, modeling

## How does release speed affect launch speed? 

```{r, speed, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}
#Remove NA's
Batting <- Batting %>% 
  filter(!is.na(release_speed), !is.na(launch_speed)) 
Batting %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = release_speed, y = launch_speed)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color= "#238A8DFF") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(y= "Launch Speed (mph)", x = "Release Speed (mph)")
       
#title = "Comparing pitcher's release speed to batter's launch speed"

## Significance tests for handedness

```{r test for significance, out.width='25%', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = FALSE}

#Proportion of on-base

prop_Batting %>% 
  filter(events == "On-base") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = events, y = prop, fill = hand)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  theme_bw()

stand_onbase <- prop_Batting %>% 
  filter(events == "On-base")

t_onbase <- t.test(stand_onbase$prop)


#Proportion of outs

prop_Batting %>% 
  filter(events == "Out") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = events, y = prop, fill = hand)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  theme_bw()

stand_outs <- prop_Batting %>% 
  filter(events == "Out")

t_outs <- t.test(stand_outs$prop)


#Proportion of home-runs

prop_Batting %>% 
  filter(events == "Homerun") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = events, y = prop, fill = hand)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  theme_bw()

stand_hr <- prop_Batting %>% 
  filter(events == "Homerun")

t_hr <- t.test(stand_hr$prop)

library(broom)
library(purrr)

tab <- map_df(list(t_onbase, t_outs, t_hr), tidy)
  
```

***At alpha level 0.05, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the proportion of on-base, outs, and home-runs between left and right-handed batters are different.***

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(events = c("Onbase", "Outs", "Homerun"),
           p_values = tab$p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = 'html')
